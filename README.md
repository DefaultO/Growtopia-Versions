# Growtopia Versions
Repository containing Setups and the Executables for older and up-to-date Growtopia Versions. This is the biggest inofficial collection of official Growtopia.exe's and GrowtopiaInstallers.exe's!

Thanks to [**@TheLeftExit**](https://github.com/TheLeftExit) we got over **two Gigabytes** of signed untampered official Installers and thus the interesting Growtopia Executables for every version from V1.44 to V3.66 archieved for everyone to access for whatever their reasoning is. The here listed Executables can be used to follow the changes made from version to version.

I use them to documentate mistakes done by the Developers and possibly one day explain the Dupes in code that existed throughout the years from 2013 till now. Another benefit of having access to any Version you'd need today is that you can find stuff in the new version that you found in the old version. Extra applications could be to auto-fetch the hashes and compare "patched" Growtopia.exe's with the official ones. So you can find tampering more easier and determine if there is malicious code added.
