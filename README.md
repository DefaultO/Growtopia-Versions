# Growtopia-Versions
Repository containing Setups and the Executables for older and up-to-date Growtopia Versions.

The Executables can be found under [Releases](https://github.com/DefaultO/Growtopia-Versions/releases). Sorted by the Game Version thanks to GitHub's Tag Versioning.

**In case someone from Ubisoft reads this, this repository does exist, because many people profit from having access to binaries for older versions for this game. Whether they are people that move to older versions for compatibility issues, the private server movement (which we do not support), and so on. Me, myself, including, as I and other highly-minded individuals are documenting the mistakes done by you, giving us things to discuss and report to you from time to time. We also don't want a 1-Hit to exist for over a year.**

**Please do not take down this repository at all costs. It is supposed to be an archive containing history.**
