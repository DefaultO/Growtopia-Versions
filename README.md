# Growtopia Versions
Repository containing Setups and the Game Executables for older and up-to-date Growtopia Versions. This is the biggest unofficial collection of official Growtopia.exe's and GrowtopiaInstallers.exe's! The Downloads to them can be found [**HERE**](https://github.com/DefaultO/Growtopia-Versions/releases) under releases.

Thanks to [**@TheLeftExit**](https://github.com/TheLeftExit) we got over **two Gigabytes** of signed untampered official Installers and thus the interesting Growtopia Game Executables for most versions ranging from V1.44 to V3.66 archived for everyone to access for whatever their reasoning is. The here-listed Executables can be used to follow the changes made from version to version.

This sniping of those files was also interesting to follow because the 1.XX Game Versions used to have 2-different Executables for 32-/ and 64-bit. Including a phase where severe Game Executables had different amounts of file sizes based on who downloaded them. Possibly to fight the there upcoming Sethmumu.eu community that made Cheat Engine Trainers.

I use them to document mistakes done by the Developers and possibly one day explain the Dupes in code that existed throughout the years from 2013 till now. Another benefit of having access to any Version you'd need today is that you can find stuff in the new version that you found in the old version. Extra applications could be to auto-fetch the hashes and compare "patched" Growtopia.exe's with the official ones. So you can find tampering more easier and determine if there is malicious code added. Useful when you don't trust "patched" versions online. This is easy to understand after all these hypes around stealing Accounts to profit in-game.

I strive for a community that doesn't abuse its users.
